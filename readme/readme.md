# Community Science Museum

Community Science Museum is a website for a fictional science museum built using only HTML and CSS. It was our first real project in year one.

Images and text were provided in the brief, but I also contacted a real science museum for inspiration and received permission to use some of their content. Check it out to see what we came up with!
